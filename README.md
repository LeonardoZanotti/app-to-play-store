# Build and publish an app in Play Store
How to build an Android app in Android Studio and publish it in the Google Play Store.

## APK file
APK refers to the Android Package Kit (also Android Application Package) which is used in the Android operating system for the distribution and installation of mobile apps. For instance, you tend to use .exe file for installing software in your PC, similarly, .apk files are used to install Android application on your phone.

## Signed APK file
As for the developer, an unsigned APK file is developed mainly for local testing purposes. Furthermore, these APK files can be made publicly available. However, Google Play Store does not accept these files as unsigned APK files are not secure. Here, an unsigned APK is more like a zipped file that can get unzipped easily without any security. So, in case if the unwanted individuals unzip the files and unzip the APK file, they can have access to the code because of which you may lose your authority to the files.

Now, talking about generating signed APK files, it is secured by a Keystore credential made by the developer and includes a password for the security purpose. Therefore, Signed APK cannot be easily unzipped and mainly used for production purposes. In conclusion, if you are generating a signed APK file, it is more secure and also acceptable in Google Play Store.
